### Project Description
TrashTalks is an anonymous platform where college students can vent, mock, and celebrate their college life. It provides a safe space to express frustrations, share inside jokes, and connect with others, all while promoting mental well-being through humor and community.

### The Problem statement
College life is often a cocktail of stress, pressure, and unspoken struggles. But where do students go to let off steam without judgment? Social media? Too public. Therapy? Too formal. The real problem: students lack a fun, anonymous space to speak their minds without consequences.

### The Solution
TrashTalks is here to solve that problem by giving students an anonymous stage to roast, rant, and reflect on their college journey. It‚Äôs like a campus-wide confessional, but funnier and with a community of people who get it‚Äîwhere honesty meets humor, and stress turns into laughter.
